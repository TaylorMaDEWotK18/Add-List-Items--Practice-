/*Step 6-Copied over CSS portion in google font make up and set margin, padding and box-sizing

Step 7-Set up min-height, background, display, flex directing and align items in the body and centered it with column property to make it look fanstastic 

Step 8-Styled h1 and gave it top margin and then took on the form and gave it margin top space, background color and box shadown!

Step 9-Styled to form input, increased the width size, height, took off the border and that annoting outline and gave mild padding

Step 10-Styled form button and completely made it fit to the search bar, adjusted background color and color of plus symbol. Also gave it the awesome pointer when you hover over it
